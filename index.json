In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers work on a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe subsamples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct 6 experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. In line with the predictions of the model of optimal evaluations we find that ratings are more lenient and less accurate when they determine bonus payments and that rewards for accuracy reduce leniency. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information their ratings vary to a stronger extent with observed performance. In contrast to the model's prediction we do not find that more prosocial supervisors always provide more lenient ratings, but that they invest more time in the rating task and achieve a higher rating accuracy.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Social Preferences and Rating Biases in Subjective Performance Evaluations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"9b98238c20154a18eb9365ff408a9b27","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/rate-this-transaction/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rate-this-transaction/","section":"publication","summary":"Reputation feedback systems assign feedback scores to traders with the aim of separating them according to reliability. There is now a substantial literature on what these mechanisms do well and not so well.  Conspicuously absent is a theoretical framework to guide thinking on improving these systems. Here we construct a prototype market, stylized and conceptual in nature, but also suitable for lab testing. We use the prototype to examine competing approaches to eliciting feedback from traders. Using entropy to benchmark informativeness, we show that the informativeness of feedback elicitation approaches depends on the ability to solve a coordination problem such that traders use a common mapping to turn experiences into ratings. In theory, different approaches can be about equally informative although the map to coordinate on is more ambiguous in some cases. We then test the approaches in the lab. The resulting data finds that the most informative feedback is associated with the elicitation methods where the solution to the coordination problem is least ambiguous.","tags":null,"title":"Rate this transaction: Coordinating mappings in market feedback systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer","Achim Wambach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"ecd5ee558968c00b64f478238fedf743","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/searching-for-evidence/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/searching-for-evidence/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze a situation where an uninformed decision-maker has to decide on an issue. There are two parties with state-independent opposing interests who can acquire information in support of their cause through costly search. Information can be obtained across multiple dimensions. A decision is more complex the more dimensions are available for investigation. Each party has to decide on the number of searches it performs. If there is an asymmetry between the parties with regard to the utility they derive from decisions in their favor, we show that a reduction of complexity can lead to an overall increased and more balanced search which may improve welfare.","tags":null,"title":"Searching for Evidence: Less can be More","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Kusterer","\u003cdisplayName\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"bb3007a75585cc271bdb344b5d32b215","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/pgo/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pgo/","section":"publication","summary":"How should ownership rights be allocated in public-good settings? We report data from a laboratory experiment with 480 participants that was designed to test a public-good version of the property rights theory based on incomplete contracting. Consider two parties, one of whom can invest in the provision of a public good. The parties value the public good differently. In the literature it has been argued that more investments will be made if the high-valuation party is the owner, regardless of whether or not this party is the investor. Our experimental results cast some doubts on the robustness of this conclusion.","tags":null,"title":"Public Goods, Property Rights, and Investment Incentives: An Experimental Investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer","\u003cdisplayName\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"c102d3a2416d34e006a7d1466755d6e8","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/inflated-reputations/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inflated-reputations/","section":"publication","summary":"The reputation information provided by market feedback systems tends to be compressed in the sense that reliable and unreliable sellers have similar feedback scores. The experiment presented here features a market in which what a buyer receives is a noisy signal of what was actually sent. We focus on the influence the noise has on endogenously given feedback. The attributional uncertainty creates room for leniency in feedback giving. We find that buyer leniency reduces the informativeness of the feedback system and, in combination with uncertainty, diminishes seller trustworthiness. With a noisy signal, buyers pay about the same prices but get significantly less.","tags":null,"title":"Inflated Reputations: Uncertainty, Leniency, and Moral Wiggle Room in Trader Feedback Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Kusterer","\u003cdisplayName\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"fdf81ba6fce9d461402fc7265dbc1b68","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/moi/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moi/","section":"publication","summary":"We report data from a laboratory experiment with 576 participants that was designed to test Aghion and Tirole's (1994a) management of innovation theory which is based on the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach.

In line with the theoretical predictions, we find that ownership matters for the division of the revenue and the investments.

Our experimental study compares two different modes of provision. In a public-private partnership, the two tasks of building the infrastructure and operating it are delegated to one private contractor (a consortium), while under traditional procurement, these tasks are delegated to separate contractors. We find support for the theoretical prediction that, compared to traditional procurement, a public-private partnership provides stronger incentives to make cost-reducing investments (which may increase or decrease service quality). In two additional treatments, we study governance structures which explicitly take subcontracting within the private consortia into account.","tags":null,"title":"Public-Private Partnerships versus Traditional Procurement: An Experimental Investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1322697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1322697600,"objectID":"a6d792413c97c093623afc40d4bb862a","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/ct/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ct/","section":"publication","summary":"We study a multi-task principal-agent problem in which tasks can be in direct conflict with each other.
