study biases and the informativeness of subjective performance evaluations in an MTurk experiment, testing the implications of a standard formal framework of rational subjective evaluations. In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct 6 experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors' social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect worker's payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Social Preferences and the Informativeness of Subjective Performance Evaluations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"9b98238c20154a18eb9365ff408a9b27","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/rate-this-transaction/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rate-this-transaction/","section":"publication","summary":"Reputation feedback systems assign feedback scores to traders with the aim of separating them according to reliability. There is now a substantial amount of literature on what these mechanisms do well and not so well. Conspicuously absent is a theoretical framework to guide thinking on improving these systems. Here we construct a prototype market, stylized and conceptual in nature, but also suitable for laboratory testing. We use the prototype to examine competing approaches to eliciting feedback from traders. Using entropy to benchmark informativeness, we show that the informativeness of feedback elicitation approaches depends on the ability to solve a coordination problem such that traders use a common mapping to turn experiences into ratings. In theory, different approaches can be about equally informative although the map to coordinate on is more ambiguous in some cases. We then test the approaches in the laboratory. The resulting data find that the most informative feedback is associated with the elicitation methods where the solution to the coordination problem is least ambiguous.","tags":null,"title":"Rate this transaction: Coordinating mappings in market feedback systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cdisplayName\u003e","David Kusterer","Achim Wambach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"ecd5ee558968c00b64f478238fedf743","permalink":"https://djkusterer.github.io/publication/searching-for-evidence/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/searching-for-evidence/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze a situation where an uninformed decision-maker has to decide on an issue.
